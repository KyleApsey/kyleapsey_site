    <h1>Who I am</h1>
    <h3 class="eyebrow">A quick story</h3>
    <p>
      With over eight years of experience in web and application development, I've dedicated my career to building and
      optimizing digital experiences that prioritize engagement, web accessibility, and usability. My career has taken me
      from Detroit to New York and back again, working with startups, coding bootcamps, and established agencies, where
      I’ve been able to create meaningful, scalable web solutions and mentor upcoming developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a lead developer, I specialize in guiding projects end‑to‑end with a strong foundation in both front‑ and
      back‑end development—focusing on quality, collaboration, and delivering measurable results. I’m particularly
      passionate about web accessibility, ensuring that every project is inclusive and optimized for all users—a skill
      that I believe is essential in today’s digital landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach is grounded in adaptability and continuous learning—keeping up with evolving web technologies,
      best practices, and the user‑centric goals that ultimately define success. I’m always looking for new challenges
      that allow me to apply and expand my skills, connecting digital innovation with exceptional user experience.
    </p>

    <h3>My strengths</h3>
    <p>
      Adapting quickly, shipping dependable code, and building processes that scale for teams and long‑term maintenance.
